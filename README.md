### React with Babel ES2015

If you do not have [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/) installed run:

Yarn:
`yarn global add parcel-bundler`

or

npm: `npm install -g parcel-bundler`

---

Install dependencies:

Yarn: `yarn` 

or

npm: `npm install`

--- 

And you're ready to start messing with react:

yarn: `yarn start`

or

npm: `npm run start`



---

Note: Also has the [object spread plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/) since thats been pretty widely adopted but isn't included the latest babel presets.
